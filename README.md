# **Wake & Learn: Personalized Quiz Alarm**

Wake & Learn is an Android app that combines alarms with quizzes. Instead of just dismissing your alarm, you answer a set number of questions to turn it off. It’s perfect for language learners, students, or anyone who wants a brain-boosting start to their day.

## **Key Features**
Custom Quiz Alarm: Choose the number of questions you must answer to stop the alarm.
Flexible Question Types: Use translations, vocabulary, or any custom questions you want.
Weighted Questions System: Questions you answer incorrectly gain higher weight, so they appear more often; questions you answer correctly decrease in frequency.
Decks Support: Create multiple decks for different topics, add/remove questions directly in the app.
CSV Support: Import your own questions via CSV files and export your decks for backup or sharing.
Custom Alarm Sounds: Upload your favorite music to wake up.

## **How It Works**
Set your alarm time.
When the alarm rings, answer the required number of questions.
Questions adapt based on your performance.
Stop the alarm only after completing the quiz.
